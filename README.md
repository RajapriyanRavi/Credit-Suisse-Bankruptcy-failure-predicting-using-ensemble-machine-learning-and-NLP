Predicting Credit Suisse Bank Failure Using Machine Learning  Ensemble and NLP Approach üè¶üí°

This repository contains the code and resources for my MSc in Business Analytics dissertation at Aston University. The project aims to predict potential failures within the banking sector, specifically focusing on Credit Suisse Bank, using machine learning models. Through this project, I explore key financial indicators, risk factors, market trends, and textual data from financial reports to build a predictive model that helps identify early signs of financial distress.

Project Goals üéØ
1. Data Analysis: Analyze historical financial data, balance sheets, market trends, and textual data from annual reports to identify risk patterns.
2. Model Development: Build and evaluate various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) and apply NLP techniques to predict bank failures.
3. Feature Engineering: Apply advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy, including NLPbased features extracted from financial reports.
4. Risk Management Insights: Provide insights aligned with Basel II/III norms and credit risk modeling principles, integrating both quantitative data and qualitative assessments from textual analysis.

Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
 1. Python: For data processing, model development, and NLP tasks.
 2. Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
 3. ScikitLearn: For machine learning model development.
 4. Transformers & Hugging Face: For NLP model implementation and sentiment analysis.
 5. Power BI: For data visualization and presentation of insights.
 6. SQL: For data extraction and management.
 7. Git: For version control and collaboration.

Repository Structure üìÅ
 `/data`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
 `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks used for analysis, modeling, and NLP tasks.
 `/models`: Saved models and performance metrics, including ML and NLP models.
 `/scripts`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, training models, and NLP analysis.

Getting Started üöÄ
To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rajapriyanravi/Credit-Suisse-Bankruptcy-failure-predicting-using-ensemble-machine-learning-and-large-langual-models.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Key Highlights ‚ú®
 * NLP Analysis: Integrated NLP techniques to extract and analyze textual data from Credit Suisse's annual reports, assessing sentiment and risk from the 'Report of the Statutory Auditor' and 'Notes to the Financial Statements'.
 * Feature Engineering: Applied innovative techniques to select and refine the most relevant financial indicators, including NLPderived features.
 * Machine Learning Models: Built a robust ensemble of models, including Random Forest and Neural Networks, enhanced with textual analysis insights.
 * Power BI Dashboards: Developed interactive dashboards to visualize predictive results and trends.

Future Work üîç
 Model Optimization: Finetuning hyperparameters to further improve accuracy, including adjustments based on NLP insights.
 New Data Sources: Incorporate additional external economic indicators and refine text analysis models to capture nuanced sentiments.
Cloud Integration: Can be automated with azure's stalk of resources for storage, computing and machine learning solutions.
Custom trained NLP Models: There are some advanced NLP, Deep learning, LLM models which can further improve the model but at the cost of additional amount of data.
