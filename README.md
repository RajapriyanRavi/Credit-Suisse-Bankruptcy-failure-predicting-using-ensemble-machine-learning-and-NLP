Predicting Credit Suisse Bank Failure Using Machine Learning- Ensemble approach

This repository contains the code and resources for my MSc in Business Analytics dissertation at Aston University. The project aims to predict potential failures within the banking sector, specifically focusing on Credit Suisse Bank, using machine learning models. Through this project, I explore key financial indicators, risk factors, and market trends to build a predictive model that helps identify early signs of financial distress.

-> Project Goals
Data Analysis: Analyze historical financial data, balance sheets, and market trends to identify risk patterns.
Model Development: Build and evaluate various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to predict bank failures.
Feature Engineering: Apply advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy.
Risk Management Insights: Provide insights aligned with Basel II/III norms and credit risk modeling principles.

-> Technologies Used
Python: For data processing and model development.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning model development.
Power BI: Data visualization and presentation of insights.
SQL: Data extraction and management.
Git: Version control and collaboration.

->Repository Structure
/data: Contains raw and processed datasets.
/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and modeling.
/models: Saved models and performance metrics.
/scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training models.
/reports: Final reports and presentations summarizing the project.
